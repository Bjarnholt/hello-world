“THE ‘INTERNET OF EVERYTHING’ controlled by
a smart phone, as the trend seems to be (home
alarm systems, thermostats, home locks, automobiles—
one of the auto companies some months
ago demonstrated in a commercial a remote start
capability from a distant airport with Internet
access—etc.) really scares me. Companies and
people know how to build functional applications,
but they do not know how to build secure applications,
and it does not help when the operating
systems for these phones are not secure by design,
and, in many cases, are not updated (this is particularly
a problem for Android, where the phone
vendors, not Google, control the decision to issue
OS updates for a particular model of phone). My
secondary concern is that you have your pick of
vendor to collect the data for all of the things done
through those applications—Google, Apple, or
Microsoft.”
